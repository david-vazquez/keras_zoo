## Installation
You need to install :
- [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano) or [TensorFlow](https://github.com/Theano/Theano). Preferably the last version
- [Keras](https://github.com/fchollet/keras)

## Run experiments
All the parameters of the experiment are defined at config/dataset.py where dataset.py is the name of the dataset to use. Configure this file according to you needs.

To train/test a model in Theano, use the command: `THEANO_FLAGS='device=cuda0,floatX=float32,lib.cnmem=0.95' python train.py -c config/dataset.py -e expName` where dataset is the name of the dataset you want to use and expName the name of the experiment.

To train/test a model in TensorFlow, use the command: `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0' python train.py -c config/dataset.py -e expName` where dataset is the name of the dataset you want to use and expName the name of the experiment.

All the logs of the experiments are stored in the result folder of the experiment.
